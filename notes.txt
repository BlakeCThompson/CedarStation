35 knotts
clouds 3000 ft
visibility 1 mile
density altitude must be less than 8000
(29.92 - altimeter setting) *1000 = Pressure Altitude Correction
Density Altitude correction = (current temperature - std temp( 4deg celsius))*120 

End result for Density Altitude = take current elevation (5600) + Pressure Altitude + Density Altitude.
